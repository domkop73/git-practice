My words are weak compared to the drug
What can I really say to help?
Plus, I know what it feels like when you can't look up
I've had to deal with that myself

But I remember the sun bleeds strong and everyday under the sun
And I don't wanna scare 'em away, I just wish we were still young
Beach Rats, reckless days, foul-mouthed salty kids
All day healed by the sun and wrapped up in the ocean's lip

So how do we get to be so far away from the things we love
So sad to see a boy's love for the waves be replaced by a drug

But I remember the sun bleeds strong and everyday under the sun
And I don't wanna scare 'em away, I just wish we were still young
Beach Rats, reckless days foul-mouthed salty kids
All day healed by the sun and wrapped up in the ocean's lip
